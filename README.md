This repo is a simple demonstration on how you can build a simple ServiceProvider where you can register any Service 
(or what ever generic name you wanna call these creatures). You can then call said ServiceProvider to provide
you with an instance of that service.

The ServiceProvider uses [PHP-DI](https://github.com/php-di/php-di) to autowire any dependencies across the board making
your life really simple.
